# Night Light
This was a school project which was part of a course. The aim of the course was to learn how to use the microchip studio, assembly code and atmega4809 microcontroller.
Projects has a motion sensor, light sensor and RGB lED.

## How it works
When motion sensor senses movement and the room is dark enough, LED will turn on.
Light sensor is there to detect if the room is dark. If there is enough light in the room the LED will not turn on, even if motion sensor have sensed movement.
If there is no movement in eight seconds or rooms main lights are turned on the LED will turn off.
